# Learning Journal - LoPTA Project

## Goal

To create a log parser for multiple log types - auth.log, apache2/access.log, apache2/error.log - with AI triage assistance capabilities.

## Functions and features
- Parsing the logs into variables.
- Exporting the data to CSV
- Using Argparse for running in command line.
- Using AI module for triage assistance - API (OpenAI) and local (Ollama).

## What I've learned

### General Python and Jupyter Notebooks
* Using modular construction of Python scripts, `__init__`.
* Creating modules and methods and importing them.
* Exporting as .py from JupyterLab. Debugging all sorts of issues with this, directories and paths.
* Argparse.

### Regex
* Improved my regex powers tremendously!
* Learned how to use regex101, which is the second best website ever after TryHackMe. First regex statement took maybe 30 minutes to get right. Working with regex101 and learning the ropes, later statements were done in less than 5.
* Learned how to debug and convert from Python/non-Python

### Pandas
* Did Kaggle mini course.
* Learned basic Pandas methods, even though LoPTA only makes very minimal use of Pandas (DataFrames, and reading from & writing to csv).

### AITA - AI Model
* Practice using the OpenAI API.
* Using Ollama, testing different modules, using temperatures, timing modules, assessing and comparing results.
* Fixing LLM output to make it usable.
* Patience, persistence, insistence and sensibility.

## Summary

This modest project is my most ambitious Python project to date. Implementing it took a lot of learning, including learning about what I had to learn. I have learned much about developing a multimodal project, debugging and project architecture design, and believe I acquired some valuable cybersecurity and AI skills. By conducting an awful lot of LLM runs, I gained insight into how to use them more effectively â€” improving efficiency, speed, and accuracy, and handling the challenges they pose.
